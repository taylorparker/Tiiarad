          <h2 class="hipaa-text-bold">For Treatment:</h2>
          <p class="hipaa-text">We may use Protected Health Information to give you medical treatment or services and to manage and coordinate your medical care.

          <h2 class="hipaa-text-bold">For Payment:</h2>
          <p class="hipaa-text">We may use and disclose Protected Health Information so that we can bill for the treatment and services you get from us and can collect payment from you, an insurance company, or another third party.  For example, we may need to give your health plan information about your treatment in order for your health plan to pay for that treatment.  We also may tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to find out if your plan will cover the treatment.  If a bill is overdue we may need to give Protected Health Information to a collection agency to the extent necessary to help collect the bill, and we may disclose an outstanding debt to credit reporting agencies.  </p>
